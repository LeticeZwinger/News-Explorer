# Description
  News Explorer is a responsive web application built with React and Vite that allows users to search for their favorite articles from various sources via the News API. Users can explore headlines, view detailed articles, and save their favorites for later—all within a modern, mobile-friendly interface. The project features dynamic search functionality, smooth modal interactions for sign-in and registration, and a clean, engaging user experience.

This is the Final Project of Triple10 web dev program. In this project we practice:

* HTML Semantics
* Structuring content meaningfully for accessibility and SEO
* CSS Properties, Grid, and Flexbox Layouts – Building responsive and visually appealing designs.
* Responsive Web Design & Media Queries – Adapting layouts for different screen sizes.
* Modern JavaScript (ES6+) & React – Creating dynamic, component-based user interfaces.
* RESTful APIs – Integrating external data sources with API calls.
* Version Control with Git & GitHub – Managing code changes and collaborating effectively.
* Code Quality Practices – Enforcing consistency with ESLint and best practices.
* Deployment – Publishing the final project on GitHub Pages.
