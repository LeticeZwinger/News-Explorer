News Explorer

News Explorer is a responsive React application that allows users to search for news articles, view results in a clean grid layout, and save their favorite articles. Users can sign up and sign in to save articles, and the app adapts its layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Features
• News Search: Users can search for news articles via the News API.
• Responsive Design: The layout adjusts for desktop, tablet, and mobile (including special mobile navigation and stacked layouts).
• User Authentication (Simulated): Users can sign up and sign in. Although authentication is simulated (with stubbed responses), it demonstrates the flow.
• Saved Articles: Logged-in users can save articles and view them on a dedicated Saved Articles page.
• Modals: The app uses modals for sign in, sign up, and success notifications with smooth transitions.
• Modern Styling: Uses CSS flexbox and grid, media queries, and custom animations.

Technologies
• React – A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
• Vite – A fast build tool for modern web projects.
• React Router – For client-side routing.
• CSS – For styling, including responsive design with media queries.
